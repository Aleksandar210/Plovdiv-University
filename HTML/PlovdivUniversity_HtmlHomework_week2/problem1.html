                    Benjamin Engel, a hacker from Berlin, sits in an interrogation room.<br>
                     The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of Europol, that Benjamin asked for her to do the interrogation.<br>
                      Benjamin says that he has information regarding FRI3NDS, a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the Russian cyber mafia,<br>
                       and MRX, an infamous hacker known on Darknet; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne<br>
                     if she listens to him. Having no choice, Hanne sits down.
